                <p>
                    5G is a network that can meet explosive data demands anytime and anywhere, and 5G wireless networks will use higher frequency band transmission technologies in both mobile and fixed networks. To achieve high-frequency transmission, low dielectric constant and low dielectric loss materials must be used. The excellent properties of low moisture absorption, electrical stability, and chemical inertness of polytetrafluoroethylene are very suitable for data transmission cables that require low attenuation. As one of the materials with the lowest dielectric constant in organic materials, it will be widely used in the field of 5G communication, including base station filters, high-frequency and high-speed PCB/FPC, 5G chip processes, as well as high-frequency connectors, cables, and other fields.
                </p>
                <p>The motherboard of 5G mobile phones adopts a printed circuit board (PCB) based on PTFE high-frequency copper-clad laminate to reduce signal loss. The RF signal transmission between the 5G mobile phone RF module and antenna module is completed through PTFE micro RF coaxial cable, ensuring low loss of high-frequency and high-speed signals for the mobile phone.

                <h1>Electronic and Electrical</h1>
                <p>The dielectric constant of polytetrafluoroethylene is relatively small, so it can be used to prepare enameled wire for use in micro motors. PTFE glass paint cloth and glass cloth are used to make high-temperature and high-frequency insulation materials, which can be used in satellite communication and computer applications; PTFE film is used to make capacitors, as insulation layer, gasket, cable, etc. between instruments; PTFE thin-walled tubes of different diameters are used for lead out conduit, heat shrink tubing and spiral tubing, as well as insulation water intake pipes for generators.
                </p>
                <p>
                   
<br>1. Insulation layer for wires and cables: The high insulation properties of PTFE make it an ideal insulation material for wires and cables, effectively preventing current leakage and ensuring safe use. For example, Dankai's PTFE heat shrink tubing can be used to wrap insulation materials for wires.
<br>2. Circuit board substrate: PTFE's high temperature resistance and stable electrical performance make it an ideal choice for high-frequency and microwave circuit substrates.
<br>3. Capacitors: The low dielectric constant and low dielectric loss of PTFE film make it an ideal material for making capacitors, which perform well in communication and radar equipment.
<br>4. Other electrical components: PTFE is also suitable for making insulation gaskets, electrical connectors, and other components that require excellent electrical performance and corrosion resistance. PTFE perfectly meets these requirements.
