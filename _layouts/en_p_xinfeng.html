                <p>Environmental regulations are becoming increasingly strict, and pollution control has become a problem that must be faced in terms of environment, finance, and law. Jiamo's bag filter, as an efficient dust collector, is widely used in various industrial waste gas dust removal, such as light industry, machinery manufacturing, building materials, chemical industry, non-ferrous metallurgy, and steel enterprises. It has a simpler structure, lower investment, stable operation, and can also recover dust that is difficult to recover compared to electrostatic precipitators.

                    Bag filter, as an efficient dust collector, is widely used in various industrial waste gas dust removal, such as light industry, machinery manufacturing, building materials, chemical industry, non-ferrous metallurgy, and steel enterprises. It has a simpler structure, lower investment, stable operation, and can also recover dust that is difficult to recover compared to electrostatic precipitators; Therefore, for fine and dry dust, it is suitable to use a general bag filter for purification, but its particle purification accuracy is only 50 milligrams per cubic meter. Conventional bag filters are not suitable for purifying gases containing oil mist, condensed water, and adhesive dust, and are generally not resistant to high temperatures.

                <h1>Efficient HEPA</h1>
                
                <p>
                    HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air Filter) means high-efficiency air filter in Chinese. HEPA is divided into five materials: PP (polypropylene) filter paper, glass fiber, composite PP/PET (polyethylene terephthalate, polyester) filter paper, melt blown polyester non-woven fabric, and melt blown glass fiber.
                </p>
                <p>HEPA filter material is made of chemical fiber meltblown or fiber laminated or woven, and its filtration mechanism has the following four types:
                    <br>(1) The first one is the interception mechanism, which works on large particles.
                    <br>(2) The second mechanism is the influence of gravity. Particles with small volume and high density will experience a decrease in velocity when passing through a HEPA filter and naturally settle onto the HEPA. This process is somewhat similar to the sedimentation of sediment in water downstream of a river.
                    <br>(3) The third mechanism of HEPA filters is the influence of airflow. Due to the uneven weaving of HEPA filters, a large number of air vortices are formed, and ultra small particles are adsorbed on the HEPA filter due to the influence of this cyclone, achieving the purpose of filtration.
                    <br>(4) The fourth filtering mechanism is that ultrafine particles collide with HEPA filter fibers under Brownian motion and are affected by van der Waals forces, resulting in adsorption and filtration. It can be seen that in addition to the first mechanism of intercepting large particles, it utilizes the static electricity at the fiber roots to adsorb small particles and achieve filtration effect.

                    4M-PTFE membrane is a product that truly filters PM2.5 and PM10 at once, achieving 99.7% without the need for repeated filtration of indoor unclean air like indoor purifiers. The use effect of 4M-PTFE membrane is not affected by the environment in any way. Generally, HEPA filters fail when the environmental humidity is high, and their performance significantly decreases after more than 3 uses. When faced with outdoor pollution, the most important thing for people living in homes and offices is clean outdoor air to ventilate them. When there is severe outdoor pollution, windows cannot be opened for ventilation. Although indoor air purifiers can be turned on, the concentration of carbon dioxide indoors will gradually increase. When carbon dioxide exceeds a certain amount, it can affect human respiration due to an increase in the concentration of carbonic acid in the blood, which enhances acidity and leads to acidosis. When the volume fraction of carbon dioxide in the air is 1%, feeling stuffy, dizzy, and palpitations; Feeling dizzy at 4% -5%. Because carbon dioxide is heavier than air and concentrated in lower areas, high concentrations of carbon dioxide pose greater harm to indoor children.
