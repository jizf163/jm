                <h1>generality</h1>
                <p>The biopharmaceutical sector belongs to a relatively cutting-edge field. Currently, only two companies in the world, GE and POLL from the United States, can independently complete product research and development and market operations. A few other composite material production companies in Japan, the United States, and other countries use the base film of these two companies. At present, Jiamo Company has completed the research and development of basic films and composite products, which have reached the production standards of manufacturers in the industry in Europe and America. We strive to complete localization substitution within the next five years. In the field of medical protection, Jiamo Company has reached the international leading level, and its products have been produced on a large scale. Currently, there are sufficient orders for protective products. The PTFE medical protective material developed and mass-produced by the company is known as the "respiratory protective suit" due to its excellent protection, breathability, and aging resistance, and is a medical protective product in the post pandemic era.

                <h1>BioMedem ® Biomedical Filter Membrane</h1>
                <p>The size of bacteria is usually greater than 1 μ m, and the pore size of PTFE membrane can reach 0.02 μ m, achieving ultra clean filtration of gases and liquids. The self-cleaning function of the membrane surface (friction coefficient ≤ 0.04) can also prevent bacteria from accumulating on the membrane surface; PTFE microporous membrane has excellent high temperature resistance (260 ℃), chemical corrosion resistance (strong acid and alkali), hydrophobicity (water absorption rate of about 0.001% -0.005%), and is an ideal choice for sterile exhaust of non-aqueous solvents, acids, and corrosive liquids. After hydrophilic modification, it can also be used for sterilization and filtration of aqueous solutions, as well as the manufacturing of various medical protective equipment.

                <h1>New ePTFE Medical Protective Material</h1>
                <p>The fabric is made of non-woven lining, PTFE film, and non-woven lining composite. PTFE membrane is made of polytetrafluoroethylene as raw material, using special processes such as rolling, extrusion, biaxial stretching, and high-temperature shaping. The membrane surface is covered with original fiber like micropores with a porosity of over 90%, and there are up to 9 billion micropores per square inch. PTFE membrane can block water droplets, particles, and bacteria from passing through, allowing water vapor to pass through, and has excellent waterproof, breathable, breathable, and antibacterial effects. The fabric has good water wash color fastness, can be washed less than ten times, prevents shrinkage, is non combustible, non-toxic and non irritating, harmless to the skin, and wear-resistant properties Due to the controllable pore size of polytetrafluoroethylene microporous membrane at around 0.2 μ m, it is a new type of protective clothing fabric. After being compounded with fabric, it can be made into protective clothing to block the passage of viruses. In addition, the material itself has waterproof and transparent functions, which also brings better comfort to users. The most important function of blocking bacteria and viruses reaches 100%, coupled with its high breathability, allowing the user's skin to breathe freely while wearing, and the body can work in an aerobic state. Humanized design, breathable, waterproof, bacteria resistant, flame retardant, anti-static, anti-aging, anti permeability and other functions, is the best equipment material for medical staff.

                <h4  style="margin-top: 20px;">Artificial heart valve</h4>
                <p>Mechanical valve is a type of heart valve made of artificial materials that can be implanted into the heart to replace damaged natural heart valves, thereby achieving one-way blood flow and possessing the function of natural valves. The composition of a mechanical valve usually includes three parts: the hard material used to make the stent, the elastic material used to make the blocking body, and the textile material used to make the valve annulus. Bracket materials typically include cobalt chromium nickel alloy, titanium, polyacetal resin, and polytetrafluoroethylene.
                </p>
                <h4>Preparation of artificial blood vessels</h4>
                <p>Artificial blood vessels are usually made of synthetic materials such as nylon, Dacron, and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), among which the market share of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene artificial blood vessels is relatively high. Artificial blood vessels are suitable for vascular bypass surgery throughout the body. Currently, artificial blood vessel products used in clinical practice include composite wall artificial blood vessels, autologous tissue graft artificial blood vessels, Y-shaped artificial blood vessels, cone shaped artificial blood vessels, etc.</p>
