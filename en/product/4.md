description: PTFE membrane has been widely used in the field of biomedicine because of its excellent biocompatibility, chemical resistance, hydrophobicity and mechanical flexibility. It can be used to manufacture implantable medical devices (such as artificial blood vessels, heart valves), drug delivery systems, tissue engineering stents, medical device coatings, etc. In addition, PTFE membranes are used in aseptic filtration, hemodialysis and laboratory equipment to ensure high cleanliness and low adsorption.The application of PTFE membranes in the biomedical field covers many aspects from medical devices to drug delivery, providing efficient, safe and reliable solutions for the medical industry.
