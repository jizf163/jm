detail:  <p>Core Technology:PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) waterproof and breathable laminated fabrics are formed by laminating PTFE microporous film with ordinary fabrics using a special adhesive. Under the action of water pressure, the fabric does not allow water to penetrate, while the sweat vapor emitted by the human body can diffuse or pass through the fabric to the outside, without accumulating and condensing between the body and the fabric.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/20241001221810.jpg"  class="img-thumbnail" style="width:300px;text-align:center"/></p><p>First produced by the American company W.L.Gore (Gore) in the mid-1970s, Gore-Tex fabric produced by the company has excellent waterproof, breathable, and insulating properties, allowing it to be used in harsh weather conditions such as cold rain and snow, strong winds, etc. It was supplied in large quantities to the armies of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, as well as high-end civilian use, and was virtually monopolized for nearly three decades.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/20241001221900.jpg"  class="img-thumbnail" style="float:right; width:200px; margin-left:20px"/>Research on PTFE waterproof and breathable laminated fabrics in China started relatively late, as the technology has many bottlenecks, and there are very few companies in China that can produce high-quality, high-performance PTFE microporous films!</P><p>Giamor company, determined to surpass international advanced levels, faced with the huge demand for high-quality textile membranes both at home and abroad, began researching and developing polyfluorotetrafluoroethylene microporous films with independent intellectual property rights in 2007. After years of dedicated research and testing, the company has invested huge manpower and material resources (with a cumulative investment of nearly 100 million yuan) and finally developed the 4M-PTFE membrane and its textile fabric lamination process with excellent properties. The key indicators of the product are at the world's leading level, and its overall performance has reached the advanced international level.</p>
