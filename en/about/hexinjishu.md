detail:  <p>Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) waterproof and breathable laminated fabric is formed by laminating PTFE microporous film with ordinary fabric using a special adhesive. The fabric is not penetrated by water under a certain pressure, while sweat vapor emitted by the human body can diffuse or be transmitted to the outside through the fabric, without accumulating and condensing between the body surface and the fabric.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/20241001221810.jpg"  class="img-thumbnail" style="width:300px;text-align:center"/></p><p>Originally created by W. from the United States L. Gore Company produced Gore Tex fabric in the mid-1970s. Due to its excellent waterproof, breathable, and warm properties, the fabric can be used in harsh environments such as severe cold, rain, snow, and strong winds. It was supplied in large quantities to the military and high-end civilian industries of countries such as the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, monopolizing the market for nearly thirty years.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/20241001221900.jpg"  class="img-thumbnail" style="float:right; width:200px; margin-left:20px"/>The research on PTFE waterproof and breathable laminated fabrics started relatively late in China. Due to the large bottleneck of this technology, there are very few enterprises in China that can produce high-quality and high-performance PTFE microporous films!</P><p>Jiamo Company, with the determination to catch up with the international advanced level, faced the large demand for high-quality textile membranes both domestically and internationally. Since 2007, it has been developing a polytetrafluoroethylene microporous film with independent intellectual property rights. After years of dedicated research and development, and spending huge manpower and material resources (with a cumulative investment of nearly 100 million yuan), it has finally successfully developed a 4M-PTFE membrane with excellent characteristics and its textile fabric lamination process. The key indicators of the product are in a world leading position, and the overall performance has reached the international advanced level.</p>
